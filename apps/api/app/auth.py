"""Opt-in API-key auth for sensitive/mutating endpoints (PRD Phase 9 hardening).

When `FLORALENS_API_KEY` is unset (the default — local demo, existing e2e),
`require_api_key` is a no-op: every endpoint stays exactly as open as it is
today. When set, it requires a matching key on whichever endpoints declare it
as a dependency, via either an `X-API-Key` header or an `Authorization:
Bearer <key>` header — a missing/incorrect key gets a 401.

Read-only public endpoints (health, search, pipeline, galaxy,
preprocess-preview, specimen images) intentionally do NOT depend on this and
stay open regardless of the env var, per the hardening scope.
