"""Load KEY=VALUE pairs from .env file(s) into the process environment.

No python-dotenv dependency — a tiny parser so a locally-run `uvicorn` picks up
API keys the same way docker-compose or a sourced shell would, instead of
silently starting with none set (which otherwise surfaces only later as
"OPENAI_API_KEY is not set" when the naturalist assistant first runs).

FloraLens has no .env of its own; it reuses AgentForge's agent_core and its
keys, so it also reads the sibling ``agentforge/.env``. Only variables NOT
already present are set (explicit env always wins); the first file to define a
key wins. Values are never returned or logged.
